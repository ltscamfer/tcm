Introduction
-------------------

This package contains the transverse coherence minimization (TCM) algorithm written in Python3. This method estimates the back-azimuth of an air-to-ground coupled acoustic wave using an infrasound microphone and a seismometer pair. These codes are referenced in

Bishop, Haney, Fee, McKee et al.
